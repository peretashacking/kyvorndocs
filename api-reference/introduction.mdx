<Tip>
  If you are a developer of a moderately sized or larger executor or application, you can [create a ticket in Peretas Technologies](https://discord.gg/peretas) to get help setting up the API into your executor and get it featured on the Kyvorn website.

## Before you start

Before you start, here are some things you should keep in mind while developing with the Kyvorn API.

<Warning>
  All requests must be made over HTTPS or they will not be returned by the server. There is no HTTP client running on the API.
</Warning>

- You cannot use API endpoints that require logging into Kyvorn in order to use ("token" reqired). This does not apply to Kyvorn Execute endpoints.
- There is a ratelimit to the API (by IP, not by application)
- You do not need to create/generate an API key for your client, it will simply work just with integration
