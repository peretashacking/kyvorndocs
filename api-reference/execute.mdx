## What is Kyvorn Execute?

Imagine the ability to execute scripts directly from a script library without ever having to enter your executor. If your executor is Internal and supports Kyvorn Execute, you may be able to automatically connect internally instead of in the UI on Roblox launch.

## How does Kyvorn Execute work?

### Web Interface/Client

The web interface will create an executor token under the user's authorization, and then that will be saved to be "paired" to an executor.

An executor can then "pair" and connect with this token. The pairing is meant so that if a user has multiple executors/multi-instance you can easily send it to a single executor in one dashboard.

**If you only have one executor paired** then it will default to running that one automatically when the page is loaded.

### Executor

The executor will login with the user's executorToken, and set its name up so that the executor is in a Paired state.

Once in a paired state, the executor will begin making requests checking for pending scripts every 5 seconds.

In the future we will find a more efficent way of doing this that takes up less bandwith possibly (since this implementation is maybe 100+/- KB).

## [NEW] Kyvorn Execute Client Code

<Info>
  From now on, "client" is used interchangeably with the Web interface and your Executor's user interface
</Info>

Integrate this code with your client in order to have Kyvorn Execute always enabled. Code examples are Kyvorn Execute `v1.1.0`

<Warning>
  This code may need adjustments if Kyvorn Execute updates its backend in the future

## Integrating with your executor

### Setting your executor's name

Once you've put the proper file inside of your client, you'll need to make sure it runs on start. You should change the const variables at the top of the `execute.js` file you have downloaded. For example, if your executor is called _SkiddieScript_ you'd fill out the JSON like this:

```javascript
const API_SERVER_URL = "https://kyvornapi.peretas.tech"; // should stay as is unless using a development enviornment
const DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_NAME = "SkiddieScript"; // edit this to your executor's name
const SCRIPT_CHECK_WAIT_DURATION = 5000; // 5 seconds
```

It's not reccomended to change the SCRIPT_CHECK_WAIT_DURATION as it is good enough for checking scripts.

### Setting up the execute function

You'll need to find the `function execute(script)` to setup your executor's execute function. You'll need to add your custom logic that will execute the script, which is included as the variable "script".

In this example, I use the execute function from Sight which will execute the script in MacSploit. You can view the raw source code on GitHub: <https://github.com/peretashacking/sight/blob/main/src/main.js> line 124:1.

### Executing from your web browser

You'll be able to execute scripts automatically from the URL `/app/execute.html?sid=d90b09d0-fa30-45df-88f2-79b8a9cfb55c`, where the `sid` query is the post ID. It will automatically get the script content and send the request to your client.

This URL is used by the Execute button on the Kyvorn website. You can also execute scripts directly from the editor for easy script debugging.

## Branding

**Congratulations!** You just included Kyvorn inside of your application! Now, you are able to include the special Uses Kyvorn Execute badge onto your executor's website or Credits/Settings page. [You can download it on our main page here.](https://kyvorn.peretas.tech/#branding)
