Imagine the ability to execute scripts directly from a script library without ever having to enter your executor. If your executor is Internal and supports Kyvorn Execute, you may be able to automatically connect on Roblox launch.

*Image above is a mockup and will look nothing like the final product.* You are also able to directly connect to your executor and execute scripts directly from the Kyvorn Editor. You'll be able to see some basic information about your executor and execute scripts.
